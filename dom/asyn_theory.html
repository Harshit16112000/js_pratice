Javascript Asyn code

Javascript
  -> Synchronous
  -> Single thread 

-> Execution Context
    -> execute one line of code at a time
    -> console.log  -> 1
    -> console.log  -> 2

Each execution waits for the last one to complete before executing

Blocking code vs Non blocking code

BLock code -> Block the flow of Program (Read file Async)
Non Block code -> Didnot block the execution( FRead file sync)

File access -> Node Javascript
